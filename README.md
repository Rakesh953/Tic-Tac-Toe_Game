# Tic-Tac-Toe_Game
<h3>Tic-tac-toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game played on a 3x3 grid where two players, 
    typically represented by X and O symbols, take turns marking empty cells. The objective
    is to be the first to create a line of three of your symbols either horizontally, 
    vertically, or diagonally. It's a game of strategy and anticipation, often played casually
    and popular among children and adults alike [1, 2, 4].</h3>
